# G'Agent
[![Build Status](https://drone.dragonheim.net/api/badges/dragonheim/gagent/status.svg)](https://drone.dragonheim.net/dragonheim/gagent)


A mobile agent system, written in Go, loosely inspired by the [Agent Tcl / D'Agents](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/agents/) system created by Robert S. Gray of Dartmouth college.

More information can be found in the original [documentation](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/agents/pub/agents/doc.5.1.ps.gz), and in the project's [wiki](https://git.dragonheim.net/dragonheim/gagent/wiki/_pages).

We are adding Picol as a vendor package though we have modified it specific to support a subset of the [Agent Tcl / D'Agents](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/agents/pub/agents/doc.5.1.ps.gz) language extensions. The language extensions can be found in the [LANGUAGE.md](https://git.dragonheim.net/dragonheim/gagent/src/branch/main/LANGUAGE.md) file.
